# craps-game

* I am building out a craps game that allows users to learn to play the game craps which i learned to play growing up and increased my love for when I was in the military

* currently my JavaScript allows for the dice to roll, but I need to be able to operate the function more than once and allow for notifications to populate with each roll which will come to fruition once I am able to add a backend to the program
